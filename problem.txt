Problem 3 “It’s all in the genes”
DNA forms the building blocks for the each cell in the human body. DNA creates RNA which is
made up of four bases. A, C, G and U. The bases can be combined together to create a triplet
known as a codon that is responsible for protein synthesis. The following are examples of
codons:

UAA, CGC, CGA, CGG, GUA, AUG, AUC, UAA, UAG, GGU, GUA
Any one of the four RNA bases may be present in one of three positions in the codon, leading to
64 possible codon combinations. The genetic code is comprised of the set of all possible codons.
Each RNA sequence consists of a set of codons such as AUG, CUA, UUC, and UAA. The four
codons AUG, UAA, UAG, and UGA have a special meaning: AUG indicates start of the RNA
sequence, and UAA, UAG, UGA indicates the end of the sequence.

TGHUIIOPKL
BAUGUUCUGA
ERTUSDFNMU
RTYAIOPKLI
GHCAYUIOXC

The vertical sequence, AUGUAA contains 2 codons. The horizontal sequence AUGUUCUGA
has 3 codons. In this problem, you have to find the RNA sequence with the largest number of
codons. The sequences are hidden in a 2D grid in the horizontal and vertical directions.
An input file called codons.txt containing the names of all the codons is provided below:

The test case file contains data in the format
10 #Number of test cases
9 15 #Number of rows =9 Number of columns = 15

Your program should read the test cases from the input file provided below and report the output
in the following format:
Test case 1: Maximum number of codons: #
Test case 2: Maximum number of codons: #
and so on
